The Unit Controller REST API provides a programmatic interface to manage and control units (e.g., IoT devices, machinery, or other systems). It allows users to perform operations such as retrieving unit status, updating configurations, and sending commands to units over HTTP.
This API is built with [insert framework/language, e.g., Node.js, Express, Python Flask, etc.] and follows RESTful principles for simplicity and scalability.
